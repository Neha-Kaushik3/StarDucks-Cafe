# StarDucks-Cafe
Custom Token project : The idea behind this application is to buy tokens from a cafe.
The owner of cafe is able to do the KYC of account (i.e. whitelisting the account), without KYC no one can buy the tokens and no one except owner can perform KYC.
Any whitelisted customer can send ethers to the smart contract to buy tokens.
Additional tokens can be purchased using "Add Token" button.
